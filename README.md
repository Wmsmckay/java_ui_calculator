# Overview

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates the use of Swing to create a basic graphical user interface (GUI) for a calculator. The program creates a JFrame with a text field and buttons for the numbers 0-9, as well as buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, clear, and equals. The program responds to button clicks by updating the text field and performing the appropriate calculations based on the selected operator.

The purpose of this software is to provide a comprehensive example of how to use key Java features such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes to create a functional program. The program also demonstrates how to use Swing to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for a simple calculator, making it easier for users to interact with the program.
